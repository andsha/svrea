web app www.svrea.se is dedicated to fetching, and analysing past as well as current situation on the Swedish real
estate market.

Below described basic workflow and used components of the application:

Every day at 2.30am UTC a worker process (Redis/RQ) on the website (hosting Heroku) executes following procedures:
  1. Download available/sold properties in Sweden from booli.com (available in open source for non-commercial purposes)
  in text format
  3. Upload downloaded data into PostgreSQL using help of Django Models
  4. Perform ETL analysis to calculate several aggregated metrics (e.g. number of properties, their prices, areas, prices
  per area, age, and days past before they had been sold) for current (past) day, week, month, quarter, and year. This
  procedure also uses Django Models to access and upload data as well as generate queries.

The above procedures could also be done manually at any point via some sort of admin panel on the website

At any point users of the website can access aggregated data in form of plots or on the map.
Website uses google API (charts and maps) for plotting the aggregated data:

POST/GET/HTTP request -> server on Heroku -> Python/Django (receiving and handling request) -> PostgreSQL ->
-> Python/Django (generating webpage) -> server on Heroku -> Browser
